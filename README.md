## AOTY's recommendation algorithm is very limited.
To get automated recommendations on AOTY, you have to go to an album's page, scroll down to the "you may also like" section, and just see what they've cooked up. \

Obviously, this kinda sucks.

## How BetterRecs will fix it:
### 1. Better inputs
BetterRecs will allow you to find similar albums to not just one album at a time, but two, three, or even your entire rating catalog.
### 2. Better customization
BetterRecs will let you decide what exactly similar means. Recommendations will be given an overall similarity index based on how they compare to the chosen album(s) in a number of different categories. You get to determine just how similar you want your recommendations to be, whether that means you want something uncannily similar, or nothing like the inputs at all. You also get to customize what attributes to prioritize, meaning you could find albums with similar tags in an entirely different genre if you so pleased.

## Current development progress
This is a very new project! BetterRecs will almost certainly go through a lot of design changes, so the structure of everything below is subject to change.
### - Data Collection (in progress)
Web scraping architecture (using scrapy) is currently being built.
### - Algorithm Development (not started)
### - Web Application (not started)
